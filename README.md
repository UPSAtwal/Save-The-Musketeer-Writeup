# Save The Musketeer! Writeup

Writeup of Save the Musketeer CTF made by [me](https://github.com/UPSAtwal) for [SAIC](https://www.instagram.com/saic_tiet/), Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology for their event Global Leadership Summit on 15th April 2023. There were around ~80 participants in the CTF.

## CTF Description

The CTF was based on the theme of the "Saving the Musketeer". Musketeer here being your trapped teammate. Each team had to work on logic-based CTF questions while their trapped teammate (Musketeer) helped them by solving puzzles and getting hints for the CTF Questions. The team had to solve the CTF questions to get the flag which would help the Musketeer to escape. The team with the most number of flags won the CTF.

The CTF was divided into 3 categories: Easy, Medium and Hard. Each category had 3 questions.

## Technical Details

The CTF was self-hosted on Digitalocean and was based on a custom version of [FBCTF](https://github.com/facebookarchive/fbctf). A docker image was deployed and the whole CTF was hosted on a single droplet running Ubuntu 20.04. Cloudflare was used for DNS and SSL.

## Questions and Writeups

All questions were worked on by me and my team. The writeups are written by me just as an inspiration to others.
